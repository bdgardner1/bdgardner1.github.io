## Welcome to Ben Gardner's Website

I am currently studying for an integrated Masters/PhD at the University of Sheffield.

My PhD involves working with the Home Office to help improve the efficiency of border/passport control. 

### My background

I completed a BA in Economics and Politics at the University of York in 2003. I then worked as an analyst in HR for public and private organisations. 

I decided to return to academia in 2017 and started a Masters in Social Research back at York.
