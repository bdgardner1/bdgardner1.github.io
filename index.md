## About Me

![Me at Castleton](BenGardner_Castleton.jpg)

I am currently studying for an integrated Masters/PhD at [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/)

My PhD [project](projects.md) involves working with the Home Office to help improve the efficiency of border/passport control. 

### My Background

I completed a BA in Economics and Politics at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) in 2003. I then worked as an analyst in HR for public and private organisations. 

I decided to return to academia in 2017 and started a Masters in Social Research back at York.
